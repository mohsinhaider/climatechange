    <div class="climate-change-background">
      <p class="change">Scientists who study climate change confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earthâ€™s climatic trends. Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming. Precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events are increasing. </p>
        <p class="change-two">The observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every region of our country and throughout our economy. Some of these changes can be beneficial over the short run, such as a longer growing season in some regions and a longer shipping season on the Great Lakes. But many more are detrimental, largely because our society and its infrastructure were designed for the climate that we have had, not the rapidly changing climate we now have and can expect in the future.</p>

    <div class="impact-background">
      <p class="impact">Climate change is already affecting societies and the natural world. Climate change interacts with other environmental and societal factors in ways that can either moderate or intensify these impacts. The types and magnitudes of impacts vary across the nation and through time. Children, the elderly, the sick, and the poor are especially vulnerable. There is mounting evidence that harm to the nation will increase substantially in the future unless global emissions of heat-trapping gases are greatly reduced. </p>
        <p class="impact-two">Because environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are tightly coupled, climate change impacts can either be amplified or reduced by cultural and socioeconomic decisions. In many arenas, it is clear that societal decisions have substantial influence on the vulnerability of valued resources to climate change. For example, rapid population growth and development in coastal areas tends to amplify climate change related impacts.</p>

  <h2 id="help-heading">How you can help reduce climate change </h2>
    <div class="help-background">
            <div class="help">
              <p>-Ride your bike, the city of Chicago created more than 120 miles of bike path for riders.</p>
              <p>-Drive eco friendly cars. They reduce C02 emissions.</p>
              <p>-Car pooling: Take an I-GO>> or a Zipcar</p>
              <p>-Stop unwanted mail from coming (waste of paper)</p>
              <p>-Recycle old medicine</p>
              <p>-Recycle paper, plastic, and cardboard</p>
